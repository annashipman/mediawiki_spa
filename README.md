SPA MediaWiki
=============

The [SPA conference](http://www.spaconference.org/) site used to include a wiki. However, this was no longer used so this is a static version of all the files. URLs still work because [Cool URIs don't change](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI). For more info, see [Removing MediaWiki from SPA: changes to the site](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/removing-mediawiki-site-changes.html) and [Removing MediaWiki from SPA: Cool URIs don't change](https://www.annashipman.co.uk/jfdi/removing-mediawiki-cool-uris.html).

These files are hosted at [SPA MediaWiki](http://www.spaconference.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=Main_Page).
